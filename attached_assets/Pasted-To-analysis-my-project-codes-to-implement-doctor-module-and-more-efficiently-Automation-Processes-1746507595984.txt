Automation Processes by Module
üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Doctor Module
Automation Description
Auto Prescription Sync When a doctor submits a prescription, it's automatically sent to the patient‚Äôs history and the pharmacist‚Äôs dashboard.

Auto Billing After submitting a prescription, the system calculates the cost based on medicines and generates a bill automatically.

Vital Alerts If patient vitals (from manual) exceed thresholds (e.g., high BP, sugar), doctor is auto-notified.

Drug Interaction Warning While prescribing, if there's a harmful combination, system triggers an interaction alert in real-time.

I'll help analyze the code and implement the doctor module automation requirements. Looking at the provided code, I notice that some of these features are already partially implemented in different files. Let's enhance them:

For Auto Prescription Sync, the code in notification.service.ts already has a foundation but needs enhancement:
server/services/notification.service.ts
For Auto Billing functionality:
server/services/billing.service.ts
The vital alerts system is already implemented in the code but let's update the thresholds check:

For Drug Interaction Warning, we can enhance the existing checkDrugInteractions function:

client/src/pages/doctor/DoctorDashboardPage.tsx
These enhancements improve:

Auto Prescription Sync by including medication details
Auto Billing with a new dedicated service
Vital Signs monitoring with more frequent checks
Drug interaction warnings with severity levels and detailed effects

I'll analyze the code and suggest improvements to implement the missing requirements and enhance efficiency:

Drug Interaction Warning System needs enhancement:
server/services/notification.service.ts
Auto Prescription Sync needs improvement:

Auto Billing needs billing details tracking:

server/services/billing.service.ts
Vital Alerts system needs improvement:
These improvements will:

Add severity levels to drug interactions
Implement comprehensive prescription syncing
Add detailed billing tracking
Enhance vital signs monitoring with configurable alerts
The code now covers the core requirements but could be further improved with:

Error handling and retry mechanisms
Caching for frequently accessed data

I'll help improve the database operations and error handling in your backend. Here are the key improvements we should make:

First, let's create a database service to centralize connection handling:
server/services/database.service.ts
Now, let's improve the storage class to use this service:
server/storage.ts
Let's improve error handling in routes:
server/routes.ts
These changes improve the codebase by:

Centralizing database operations with connection pooling
Adding type-safe generic CRUD operations
Improving error handling and logging
Standardizing API responses
Adding proper error handling for database operations

I'll help you enhance the doctor's dashboard prescription functionality. Based on the codebase, I'll add a more robust prescription form with manual entry, bill generation, and automated features. Here's the implementation:

client/src/pages/doctor/DoctorDashboardPage.tsx
I've added comprehensive prescription management features including:

Vital signs monitoring with automated alerts
Detailed medication management with dosage, frequency, and instructions
Automated bill generation with itemized charges
Follow-up appointment scheduling
Drug interaction checking
AI-powered medication recommendations
The changes integrate with the existing database schema and notification system. When prescriptions are submitted, they will automatically:

Generate bills
Send notifications to pharmacists
Check for drug interactions
Alert on abnormal vitals
Schedule follow-ups

I'll help implement these requirements efficiently by enhancing the existing patient dashboard components. Based on the existing codebase, we'll need to modify primarily the patient dashboard and add some new components.

First, let's enhance the appointment booking functionality:

client/src/components/appointments/BookAppointmentDialog.tsx
client/src/components/patients/MedicationSchedule.tsx
client/src/components/patients/HealthTrackingForm.tsx
These components implement all the required features with proper form validation, success messages, and tooltips. They integrate with the existing UI components and follow the established patterns in the codebase.
